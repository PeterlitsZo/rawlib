# Section 1: Draw a rectangle

Rawlib is a way to draw on a canvas. It aims to encapsulate the low-level
canvas API and provide a relatively high-level API on top of it.

For example, we can use this approach to draw a square (Note: I use Solid.js
here but the rawlib is just a pure JavaScript library so you can choose the
framework you like):

```ts
import { stdWrapperCtx } from '@rawlib/std-wrapper';
import * as rr from '@rawlib/render';

function Section01Preview() {
  let canvasRef = null as HTMLCanvasElement | null;
  onMount(() => {
    if (canvasRef === null) {
      return;
    }

    // The wrapper to talk with the standard canvas API and DOM element.
    const ctx = stdWrapperCtx(canvasRef);

    // We need to define the layer and add some shapes to it, then draw it.
    const layer = rr.layer(ctx);
    const rect = rr.rect({
      left: (layer.width() - 100) / 2,
      top: (layer.height() - 100) / 2,
      width: 100,
      height: 100,
      fillStyle: 'black',
    });
    layer.add(rect);

    layer.onLayoutChanged(() => {
      rect
        .left((layer.width() - 100) / 2)
        .top((layer.height() - 100) / 2);
    })
    layer.draw();
  });

  return (
    <div style={{ height: '100%', width: '100%', position: 'relative' }}>
      <canvas
        ref={ele => canvasRef = ele}
        style={{ height: '100%', width: '100%', position: 'absolute' }}
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```

We need a `stdWrapperCtx` here to help us to talk with the standard canvas API
and its DOM element -- we design it, to make sure `@rawlib/core` can be write
without the the need of a specific environment, but just the rawlib's context
interface.  Some environment do not have a right / full canvas API (maybe you
just want to run it in your embedded JavaScript environment without real
HTML canvas element).

Then we define a `layer` and add a `rect` to it.  Finally, we draw the layer.

We put the rectangle to the center of the layer, even if the layer's size is
changed.

If the canvas's size is changed, the context need to observe the change and let
the layer to redraw, and all shapes in the layer need to recalculate their new
layout.
