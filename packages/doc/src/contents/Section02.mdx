# Section 2: Some lines

Here we want to draw some lines.  We can use the `LineShape` to draw a line.

```ts
const line = new LineShape({
  from: new Point(0, 0),
  to: new Point(100, 100),
  strokeStyle: 'red',
})
```

And using the `LineShape`, we can draw a grid behide the rectangle we draw
before.

But the lines' number is changed when the canvas's size is changed.  And its
`from` and `to` points are also changed.  So we need to recalculate the points
when the canvas's size is changed.

To make it more easy, there is a `GroupShape` -- which is just a group of
shapes.  We can init it with no lines at first, and then reset and add lines to
it when needed.

```ts
// Some lines.
const linesGroup = new GroupShape();
const initLinesGroup = () => {
  linesGroup.clear();

  // Draw the grid here.
  // ...
}
layer.onBeforeDraw(initLinesGroup);
layer.onWidthAndHeightChanged(initLinesGroup);
layer.add(linesGroup);
```

The rest of the `initLinesGroup` function is below (yes, it is a little long,
but you can find that it can be split into three parts: the grid helper, the
code to draw the grid, and the code to draw the X and Y axis):

```ts
// The grid helper function.
const addGridLines = (
  fromBasic: Point,
  toBasic: Point,
  dx: (i: number) => number,
  dy: (i: number) => number,
  needBreak: (from: Point, to: Point) => boolean,
) => {
  for (let i = 1; ; i++) {
    const from = fromBasic.shift(dx(i), dy(i));
    const to = toBasic.shift(dx(i), dy(i));
    if (needBreak(from, to)) {
      break;
    }
    
    let strokeStyle = '#eee';
    if (i % 4 === 0) {
      strokeStyle = '#ddd';
    }
    const line = new LineShape({
      from: from,
      to: to,
      strokeStyle,
    });
    linesGroup.add(line);
  }
};

// Init the grid.
addGridLines(
  layer.layout.l(), layer.layout.r(),
  _ => 0, i => i * 25,
  (from, _to) => from.y > layer.layout.b().y,
);
addGridLines(
  layer.layout.l(), layer.layout.r(),
  _ => 0, i => -i * 25,
  (from, _to) => from.y < layer.layout.t().y,
)
addGridLines(
  layer.layout.t(), layer.layout.b(),
  i => i * 25, _ => 0,
  (from, _to) => from.x > layer.layout.r().x,
);
addGridLines(
  layer.layout.t(), layer.layout.b(),
  i => -i * 25, _ => 0,
  (from, _to) => from.x < layer.layout.l().x,
);

// Init the X and Y axis.
const xAxis = new LineShape({
  from: layer.layout.l(),
  to: layer.layout.r(),
  strokeStyle: '#ccc',
});
const yAxis = new LineShape({
  from: layer.layout.t(),
  to: layer.layout.b(),
  strokeStyle: '#ccc',
});
linesGroup.add(xAxis);
linesGroup.add(yAxis);
```
